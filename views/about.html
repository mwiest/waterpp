				<h1>What is Water++</h1>
				<center><img src="views/startup.png" alt="Water++"></center>
				<p>Water++ is a mobile app that helps you to remember, track and montivate yourself for your healthy daily water consumption.</p>
				<p>On the home screen, press the big '++1' button to add a new consumption you just finished (you finished a glass). Adjust the
				details of the consumption if needed and hit 'Add'. Your stats will update immediately.</p>
				<p>In order to raise motivation, you can connect to your friends from your phone book that also use Water++ and compare your
				consumption with theirs - real time! Just hit 'Add a friend' and see who of your phone contacts already uses Water++. Once connected
				the graphs below will show the stats for you and all your friends.</p>
				<p>Finally, the settings tab allows you to set your preferences, regarding reminders. It also includes your account settings and some
				data about yourself that lets us calculate your average optimal water intake volume.</p>
